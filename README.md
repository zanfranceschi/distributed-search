# distributed-search

Distributed-Search is a proposed architecture for distributed and collaborative search. It's plataform agnostic and aims to provide very loose coupling between search and client nodes. The source code in this repository is for illustrative purposes only to show how it should work.

This pseudo protocol is more of an experiment and has a long way to go before use in production environments (if only it achieves this readiness).

A rough and very high level of how this works is depicted below:
